## CONNR
#### COmpiled laNguage learNing pRoject

The goal of CONNR is to help me gradually learn how parse and compile a language into assembly (specifically, NASM assembly).
I used to think (for some reason) that a compiler had to directly output binary files. Of course, for production languages, this is required; however, all a compiler technically has to do is output something to be assembled and linked.
Don't expect anything groundbreaking, especially at first; the first step was getting a barely-not-assembly language to compile to not-necessarily-valid assembly.
The preferred file extension is `.cnr`.
